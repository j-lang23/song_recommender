In this team project, my team members and I scrapped data from the http://millionsongdataset.com/ and https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ websites using the beautiful soup library in order to have a dataset.

We perfomed exploratory data analysis and cleaned the data using numpy and pandas library.

We made API calls to get the audio features of our music database from spotify.

We used two clustering methods from Machine learning (Kmeans and Dbscan) and decided to go ahead with Kmeans because it suited our style...

We finally had a database of all our songs and the audio features.

Finally we built a program that allows users input a song and the artist. The inputted music is then compared to songs in our database and finally returns a similar tune in our database
